# Settings
This is my settings for development in gentoo linux. 

- .Xdefaults is for configuring xterm
- init.vim is [copied from benawad](https://gist.github.com/benawad/b768f5a5bbd92c8baabd363b7e79786f), you can watch the video [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnupOrSEikQ)
- coc-settings.json is also [copied from benawad](https://gist.github.com/benawad/e187dd887f256a6a002905ec7f22ad76)
  - Note that coc-settings.json should be put in `~/.config/nvim/coc-settings.json` (as taught by benawad)
